Pattern 1: Capitalistic urges as futile and dangerous.

The narrator takes the cart of the landlord, who later ends up dead, not recognizing the need for _everyone_ to leave the town (rather than just him and his valuables).

“ ‘I’ll give you two,” said I…and so secured the dog cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his. … rushed into my house and packed a few valuables…” (p. 24, _end of chapter 9_)

The brother and two women briefly debate what to do after fleeing, and decide that all their pooled money is worthless to them.

“…they had as much as thirty pounds in gold…and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was hopeless…” (p. 57, _middle-start of chapter 16_)

A refugee loses all sense of self-preservation in attempting to pick up dropped coins and gets crushed by a horse.

“So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open, upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had been borne down under the horse’s hoofs.” (p. 60, _middle-end of chapter 16_)

Pattern 2: Increasing disconnection between earth and humans

The narrator separates himself from the rest of humanity and reduces the importance of earth down to dust.

“Few people realize the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.” (p. 5)

The narrator has just fled and is about to return the dog cart, having first ignored the needs of a fellow human (the owner of the cart) in favor of self preservation.

“The night was unexpectedly dark…” (p. 25, _start of chapter 10_)

The narrator hopes to find solace in a town, only to find it deserted.

“I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear (if there were any people inside)” (p. 27, _end of chapter 10_)

Disconnection from the world as we know it increases significantly after the attack on the brother.

“And all about him…indeed, through all the vastness of London…the first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It was the dawn of the great panic.” (p. 48, _end of chapter 14)_

Earth is disconnected from humanity fully shortly after, when the Martians destroy all the human defenders.

“the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night” (p. 50, _middle of chapter 15)_
