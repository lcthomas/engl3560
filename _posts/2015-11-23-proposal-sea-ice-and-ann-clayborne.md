  <em>Proposal for Option B:</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The levels of sea ice have been declining over the past couple of decades. Levels have been diminishing as a result of warmer atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. It is a profound indicator of climate change and functions as a significant role within climate systems. Ice has been a fundamental and variable natural substance that covers the surface of earth. It offers a habitat and ecosystem to sustain a range of creatures. Polar bears are a species that gauge the condition of a polar ecosystem. Their distribution, reproduction, and longevity of survival depend upon glacial surfaces. They are a prominent species responding to and facing the dangers stemming from the diminishing levels of sea ice. Polar bears are exhibiting dissimilar reproduction patterns and survival habits amongst numerous other behaviors. These are details that I will discuss further within my literature review. I will additionally seek an achievable solution to the dire situation as the assumed role of Ann Clayborne from <em>Red Mars.</em> The character study for Ann Clayborne will be presented within a video transcript presented as a rolling PDF with particular sections blacked out to appear as <em>“secret messages”</em> from Earth. It will consist of Ann receiving various messages from an anonymous colleague on Earth about the current state of the polar ecosystems as she remains on Mars. This will provoke a response to Ann due to her profound connection with the land beneath her feet, which I think would be similar to her reaction as though Mars were an arctic world rather than a rock world. Ann will respond with particular quotes from <em>Red Mars. </em>It will be a small portion of a play of the heated and rapid reactions that Ann has as a response to nature being transformed within <em>Red Mars, </em>which I think embodies the temperament that Ann has throughout the novel. Ann also appears at a moment of the novel as sending messages rather than finding a solution with the help of others. It is a format that will flatter Ann because she has become know to be distant from others, so I think that messages format from an unknown sender seem to convey that Ann remains alone even throughout a conversation with an assumed colleague. It will function to draw a connection between the transformation of the sea ice on Earth and the heated yet passionate responses that Ann has toward the transformation appearing Mars.
