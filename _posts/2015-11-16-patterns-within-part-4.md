While reading Part 4, one pattern seemingly stood out to me. The usage of italics happened multiple times apart from the section that begins each new Part. As I was reading through the section of Part 5, I was keeping a close eye on trying to find italicized areas. There were a couple, but nothing in comparison to Part 4.

Examples of the pattern from Part 4:

  1. &#8220;_russalkas_ and _baba yagas_&#8221; (page 208)
  2. &#8220;&#8230;he was _shaking_&#8221; (page 210)
  3. &#8220;&#8216;This is _viriditas_,&#8217; which was Latin for &#8216;greening power'&#8221; (page 211)
  4. &#8220;_There should be no such thing as fate:_ Ralph Waldo Emerson&#8221; (page 216)
  5. &#8220;Perhaps only a certain kind of _persona_ had been selected to the colony&#8221; (page 221)
  6. &#8220;&#8230;and now he _could not remember_ why he had fought so passionately to be chosen&#8221; (page 222)
  7. &#8220;My God, what _were_ they? _Nothing_ explained that, _nothing_ explained them&#8221; (page 223)
  8. &#8220;A suggestion of a smile in the voice, which Michel _did not recognize_&#8221; (page 226)
  9. &#8220;&#8230;_kami_, which was the spiritual energy or power that rested in the land itself&#8221; (page 229)

From the examples, its pretty obvious to see that italics can be used for various meanings. In examples 3 and 9, the italicized words are unfamiliar words most likely created by the author. They are followed by their definitions. Example 1 mentions two unknown words but unlike examples 3 and 9, there&#8217;s no definition.   Example 2 is an action, so the italics give an emphasis on that said action. The author may have done this to make the readers feel and imagine the shaking themselves. Example 4 is a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the only quote mentioned within Part 4.  I&#8217;ve pondered over why the author may have used the italics in example 5, but I really can&#8217;t think of a reason. When I read the sentence, I feel myself reading the word &#8220;persona&#8221; almost in a sarcastic tone. I suppose this is because each character is vastly different and they don&#8217;t fit into one persona mold. Examples 6, 7, and 8 each are passages that emphasize feelings or emotions. Example 6 shows a personal struggle of Michel and his homesickness. In example 8, Michel portrays his, I would say depression, for being apart of the Mars mission. He no longer understands why he&#8217;s there nor why he was chosen to be a part of the mission. Through Part 4 it was really easy for me to feel Michel&#8217;s homesickness and it reminded me of some times in the past I definitely felt it for myself.

Even though these examples share an overall pattern of containing italicized words, the reasons behind the italics differ. I can&#8217;t point to a main reason as to why the author used the italics in Part 4 of the book.
