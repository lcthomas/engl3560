Pattern: There is repeating instances where the protagonist, Lilith, parallels a mother figure. I think this pattern is important because I think her corporation (or lack thereof) in playing this role will determine a lot of events for the story.
  
The first instance where Lilith is seen as a mother figure is when we learn she actually was a mother. Butler writes, “Oh god. One child, long gone with his father. One son. Gone” (7).
  
Another example is when she is in captivity with Sharad and her motherly instincts for protection wanting to protect him are seen; “She worried about him and wondered how to protect him. Who knew what their captors had done to him- or what they would do?” (Butler 10).
  
A third is example is when Lilith learns that she will be the front runner for the humans returning back to earth. She will have to be a mother to them in that she will teach and guide them to be able to survive on their own. Butler writes, “You’ll Awaken a small group of humans, all English-speaking and help them learn to deal with us. You’ll teach them the survival skills we teach you. Your people will all be from what you would call civilized societies. Now they’ll have to learn to live in forests, build their own shelters, and raise their own food all without machines or outside help” (32).
  
Hypothesis 1: The symbolism of Lilith’s character will proceed throughout the entire novel and will have an impact on the events of the story.
  
Hypothesis 2: Something will happen to corrupt this symbolic pattern and Lilith will refuse to be seen as this type of character, and ignore all motherly instincts throughout the rest of the novel.
