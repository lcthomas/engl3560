I&#8217;m going to feature Burgess&#8217; &#8220;A Clockwork Orange&#8221; as my primary source. I will/might also use Zamyatin&#8217;s &#8220;We&#8221;.

The following are my secondary sources:

  Baccolini, Raffaella, and Tom Moylan. <i>Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination</i>. New York: Routledge, 2003. Print.

<div class="hang">
  Booker, M. Keith. <i>Dystopian Literature: A Theory and Research Guide</i>. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1994. Print.

  Moylan, Tom. <i>Scraps of the Untainted Sky: Science Fiction, Utopia, Dystopia</i>. Boulder, CO: Westview, 2000. Print.

<div class="hang">

  These all come from between &#8217;94 and &#8217;01, so I might also look for something much older as a comparison.
