  - Final Project Proposal
---
My final project will be based on the book <span style="text-decoration: underline">Red Mars</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Red Mars</span> has a very interesting way of describing the different forms of power held by women of the novel. I will focus on the contrast between Nadia and Maya in the ways that they have obtained authority. Women, through descriptions in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Red Mars</span>, seem to have control either through the use of their features as women (their bodies, sex, manipulation through men) or through working for it (being smart, strong willed, diligent). Maya&#8217;s influence over Frank, Michael, and John all show examples of how a woman can use their mind to change the actions of men even without lifting a finger, whereas; Nadia chooses the different path of working to prove her importance. In this paper, I will argue that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Red Mars</span> wants readers to believe that women gain the most power and authority working behind the scenes through men. Therefore, creating a dynamic of puppeteer and puppet through the use of the manipulation of men to gain control in order to fulfill the true desire of the woman.
