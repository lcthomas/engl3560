Abstract: Margaret Atwoods’ novel _Oryx and Crake_ has numerous mythical and religious allusions. The goal of my paper will be to explore the relationship between religion and science. Atheist and eugenist Crake condemns religion, yet puts himself in the role of a god. He believes the answer to humanity’s strife is located in its genome. My paper will argue that Crake has deified the gene – created a god out of hard science.
