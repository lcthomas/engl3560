**Oryx and Crake: Option A**

Throughout the entire novel _Oryx and Crake_ by Margaret Atwood, there is a heavy presence of the character of Oryx, all without her actually showing up until the very end. She influences Jimmy/Snowman through his mind, whispered words that dictate his actions all without her personally being there. In this paper, I argue that the character of Oryx, an East Asian woman with no true identity, is meant to display the misogynistic objectification of woman, all stemming from how Jimmy/Snowman feels about Oryx, ending with how her murder is simply a tool used by Crake to start his Paradice Project.
