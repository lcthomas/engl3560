On page 287, I am still kind of confused on why Ursula said that Americans think that auto repair is funny. Is it a play on words, am I overthinking it, is it supposed to be a play on cars which is why Americans find it funny? I do not understand at all.

Every different instance of it I find in the book like on page 303, “With the space elevator we are in the Terran market. Without it we will never get off Mars.”

But on Page 307 – 308, the scene between John and Phyllis is quite interesting. At first John had quite a high outlook on her “John stared at Phyllis, impressed as always by her fevor.

But the middle paragraph following it was so totally jarring to me. In the next paragraph John says “He was sick of Phyllis” and “Phyllis was just another part of the game, after all…”
