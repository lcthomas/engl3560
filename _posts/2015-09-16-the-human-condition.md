“…killed by someone else’s insanity” – 21 _In_-sanity, an absence.

“…your bodies are fatally flawed” Pg. 38—_“Your bodies_,” not you, yourselves, are the objects of fate.

“…a kind of deliberate, persistent ignorance” (89) on the part of humanity, for example: “She could no longer see him now, no matter how she turned…he was no longer part of her world” (20). Not only does humanity have no choice in its fate, but would _prefer_ not to know, a willful ignorance of the problem.

Unfortunately, though “…a cancer growing in someone’s body will go on growing in spite of denial” (39), the human condition is an incurable (by human innovations), chronic illness.

Lilith is so purposeful in her ignorance she would rather it remain: “Forgetting things is normal for most humans! I don’t need anything done to my brain!” (76)

Fortunately for her, her brain is unnecessary, or at least not as necessary to her humanity as she thinks: “Your body will tell you what to do.” (111)

**Hypothesis A.)** The human condition is purposeless, random, and uncontrollably doomed. The doom is not of our own making, though; it came about as a result of mismatched genes, a biological problem, so _we couldn’t help it_, that we destroyed the world. A random miscombination of genes, a byproduct (mistake?) of nature, caused us to destroy ourselves, something no human could have predicted, caused or changed. Therefore we hold no responsibility, or even ability, to change ourselves, the world, or the future.

**Hypothesis B.)** We are enslaved by our continual attempts at disembodiment. In other words, we deny our human condition when (in the ‘postmodern’ era) we create a mind-body dichotomy, pitting one against the other. By denying the importance of our human bodies, we have become slaves to the ‘mind,’ the continual search for why-humans-are-better-than, hence the growing cancer, in spite of persistent ignorance. Likewise, the way to true ‘freedom,’ freedom of choice that is, is an acceptance of mind/body as one and the same thing.
