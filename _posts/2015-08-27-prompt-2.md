**Close Reading Order of Operations:**

  * **Step 1: Detect a Pattern**

In your last post, you jumped right in and tried your hand at close reading. Now that you know a bit more about close reading and what it’s like, we will start to break the process down. Rather than a procedure that involves following a strict set of rules, you can think about close reading as something that adheres more loosely to an “order of operations.” This post concerns **Step 1: Detect a Pattern**.

Using what we’ve read so far from _The War of the Worlds_, find two different patterns in the text. Any two patterns. Your patterns might be organized around **repetition**: repeated words, repeated symbols, repeated metaphors, repeated settings. They might also involve **change**: how the meaning of a specific image seems to change throughout the text, for example, or how a particular character changes, or how the style of narration changes at a particular point. They might also have to do with the **structure of the text:** you might notice that certain chapters are organized in a particular way, or that the plot is repetitive or otherwise structured in a different or unexpected way. There are endless possibilities.

Once you’ve detected a pattern, cite 3-5 specific instances of that pattern from the text. This means that I want you to include specific quotes and page numbers from the text in your post. **Your task in this post is simply to find two such patterns in the novel.** In other words, you’re just making observations here; you are not using these observations to make interpretations. Not yet.

Your post should look something like this when you’re done:

Pattern 1: Description of overall pattern. How are all your pieces of evidence below related?

  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 1 from text. Notice how I am typing the exact quote as it appears in the text into my post” (page number where I found the quote).
  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 2 from text” (page number).
  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 3 from text” (page number).
  * Etc

Pattern 2: Description of overall pattern. How are all your pieces of evidence below related?

  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 1 from text. Notice how I am typing the exact quote as it appears in the text into my post” (page number where I found the quote).
  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 2 from text” (page number).
  * Description of example if needed. Do you need to explain exactly how/why this is an instance of the pattern you identify above?: “Example 3 from text” (page number).
