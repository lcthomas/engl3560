_Pattern 1:_ A pattern of statements that depict the initial disbelief that a life form could exist upon any other plant other than Earth. It simultaneously produces a pattern of blatant assumption that the creature must be a _human male_ rather than the possibility of another superior being or even another gender.

_Example 1:_ “He was so full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and _scoffed at the vulgar_ idea of its having inhabitants who were signaling us” (11). This example alludes to the attitude of ignorance toward the possibility of another being existing other than those on Earth. <span style="line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem">The attitude additionally conveys an aspect of the larger illustration surrounding a belief that the human race must be superior due to continuing to assume that the form must resemble or be that of a human. </span>

_Example 2:_ “The chances against anything man-like on Mars are a million to one,” he said” (11). This sentence contains a straightforward statement that any other form must not exist. It also conveys that the being could not possibly resemble man if it did exist.

_Example 3:_ “’Good Heavens!’ said Ogilvy. ‘There’s a man in it – men in it! Half roasted to death! Trying to escape!’” (15). This wording from Ogilvy conveys that the initial assumption was _yet again_ that the form must have been a human man rather than any other being.

_Example 4:_ “At the time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic” (18). These lines are similar to example 3 by further displaying a pattern surrounding that the assumption of the unscrewing must be either automatic or done by man rather than another being.

_Pattern 2:_ A second pattern depicting a repetition and application of color during illustrations of the Martians or the initial scenes containing a high level of fear due to the Martians. The preceding examples each contain a color within a number of pages that are relatively close to one another.

_Example 1:_ “But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow: _greyish_ billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous discs – like eyes” (21).

_Example 2:_ “There was something fungoid in the oily _brown_ skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty” (22).

_Example 3:_ “One a leash of thin _black_ whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disc that spun with a wobbling motion” (24).

_Example 4:_ “And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little _black_ knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a _white_ flag” (25).

_Example 5:_ “Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous _greenish_ smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove up, one after the other, straight into the still air” (25).
