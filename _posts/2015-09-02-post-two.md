Pattern One: The martians are introduced as being highly intelligent and &#8216;developed&#8217;, even more-so than humans from Earth. On page 8 they are described as the &#8220;immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts,&#8221; and on page 9 &#8220;their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours.&#8221;

Pattern Two: The characters that the narrator interact with, ones that have some type of significance, are never named. The wife is referred to as &#8220;my wife&#8221; from the very first mention of her on page 12. The curate, brother, and artilleryman are all grouped together as well, none of them having been granted names or even been asked for their names by the narrator.
