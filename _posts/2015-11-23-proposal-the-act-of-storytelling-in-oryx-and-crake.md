Abstract:

Margret Atwood appears to be obsessed with storytelling in her novel _Oryx and Crake_, not just the stories themselves but the actual act of storytelling. This essay will explore how the act of storytelling promotes a communal culture that utilizes storytelling to survive in the world that culture inhabits. Surviving in the post-apocalypse of _Oryx and Crake_ means: coping with loss, understanding the world, understanding other people, and bringing people together. I argue that the act of storytelling is shown to do all of these things in _Oryx and Crake_.
